Base acitivity client for discord
Was used just 2 python modules:
requests,discord.py

# How i write this
If you look at it you say "hey man, that's easy"
But I wrote this joke for half a year when it was boring. I tried about 50 variants of writing this script and only this one worked fine for me. 
I have not seen anything like this and I think it will help people who wrote these questions on stackoverflow

# How to run
Just write:
pip install -r requirements.txt or pip3 install -r requirements.txt. If you see some problem you can write pip install requests, pip install discord
and type python main.py or python3 main.pt

# Lmao
